# Porter-Stemmer
A Java code for Porter Stemmer

To execute the above program, we must dowload a few JAR files so that Porter Stemmer can be performed. And a test.txt file is also used as an input to the program which can be modified depending on the requirements.

Any queries/doubts regarding the code?
Feel free to ping me up any time. I will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
